## Congratulations to Andrew Crites and Samantha Wolfe for being named our captains for 2018.

Andrew and Samantha have been constants in our meetups, planning, and core team meetings since day one. Going forward. Andrew will serve as co-captain focusing on our internal projects, tooling, and technical strategy. Samantha Wolfe will use her co-captain position to further help connect the brigade with strategic partner. Former captain Dave Stanton will remain on the core team and coordinate new-member onboarding.
